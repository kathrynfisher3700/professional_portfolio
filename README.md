# Kathryn-Dougherty-Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my portfolio. Here you can explore my skills and talents through current projects.

ðŸ‘‹ To future employers: This website and included projects were built during an intensive UCF Coding Bootcamp (Sept-Dec 2023). If this is what I can accomplish in only 3-months, imagine the potential that awaits your company.

ðŸ‘‹ To friends, family, and explorers: I'm open for feedback, questions, and collaboration!
